We use darknet(https://github.com/kriyeng/darknet) to train Yolov3 on Google Colab for object detection.
For creating labels, see https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
But if you have just one class,use toolCreatingTrainingDatasetForYolo instead.
For download images on Google, using googleImageDownload.py
